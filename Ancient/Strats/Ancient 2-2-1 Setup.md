# Ancient 2-2-1 Setup
### B: 2 Players
1 Ramp
1 Cave
### Mid: 2 Players
Can rotate easily to A through donut, or play for retake on A
### A: 1 Player
Only one chokepoint if CTs have mid control, easy to manage with one player

### Timing
CTs can play for aggressive timings/peeks on Ancient, but there are ways for Ts to counter
